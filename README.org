* JonPRL Mode for Emacs

This is a simple major mode for the [[https://github.com/jonsterling/JonPRL][JonPRL]] implementation of
computational type theory.

Features:
 * Completion for keywords
 * IMenu
 * Simple syntax highlighting
 * Run JonPRL in compilation mode (bound to =C-c C-l=)

To install, arrange for =jonprl-mode.el= to be on your =load-path= and
then require it.

You may need to customize =jonprl-path= if the =jonprl= binary isn't
already on your PATH.

** Yasnippet integration
=jonprl-mode= gets a list of defined operators from JonPRL and uses
them to dynamically populate the Yasnippet snippet list. To enable
this feature, add =yas-minor-mode= to your =jonprl-mode-hook=.

** Dynamic highlighting of tactics
=jonprl-mode= reads the list of tactics to highlight from JonPRL
itself. If you do something that changes the list of available
tactics, restart =jonprl-mode= with =M-x jonprl-mode= to re-read them.
